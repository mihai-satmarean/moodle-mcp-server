- Moodle course ID (optional for admin tools, required for course-specific operations)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/moodle-mcp-server.git
cd moodle-mcp-server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following configuration:
```
MOODLE_API_URL=https://your-moodle.com/webservice/rest/server.php
MOODLE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
MOODLE_COURSE_ID=1  # Optional: Replace with your course ID for course-specific operations
```

4. Build the server:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage with Claude

To use with Claude Desktop, add the server configuration:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "moodle-mcp-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/moodle-mcp-server/build/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MOODLE_API_URL": "https://your-moodle.com/webservice/rest/server.php",
        "MOODLE_API_TOKEN": "your_moodle_api_token",
        "MOODLE_COURSE_ID": "your_course_id"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

For Windows users, the paths would use backslashes:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "moodle-mcp-server": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\node.exe",
      "args": [
        "C:\\path\\to\\moodle-mcp-server\\build\\index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MOODLE_API_URL": "https://your-moodle.com/webservice/rest/server.php",
        "MOODLE_API_TOKEN": "your_moodle_api_token",
        "MOODLE_COURSE_ID": "your_course_id"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

Once configured, Claude will be able to interact with your Moodle platform to:

**Course Management (Admin):**
- View and search all available courses across the platform
- Get comprehensive statistics about courses, enrollments, and activities
- Filter courses by category, name, or other criteria
- Analyze course content structures and activity distributions

**Course Content Analysis:**
- Examine detailed course structures and content organization
- View modules, resources, assignments, and other activities
- Analyze course complexity and resource distribution

**Student & Assignment Management:**
- View the list of students and their submissions
- Provide comments and grades for assignments
- Examine quiz attempts and offer feedback

## Admin vs Course-Specific Operations

The MCP server supports two types of operations:

**Admin Operations** (no course ID required):
- `get_courses` - List all courses on the platform
- `get_courses_by_field` - Search courses by various criteria
- `get_course_statistics` - Get platform-wide or category statistics

**Course-Specific Operations** (requires course ID):
- `get_course_contents` - Analyze specific course structure
- `list_students` - View enrolled students
- `get_assignments` - Manage course assignments
- `get_quizzes` - Handle course quizzes

For admin operations, you only need the Moodle API URL and token. For course-specific operations, set the `MOODLE_COURSE_ID` environment variable.

## Development

For development with auto-rebuild:
```bash
npm run watch
```

### Debugging

MCP servers communicate through stdio, which can make debugging challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector):

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.

## Obtaining a Moodle API Token

1. Log in to your Moodle site as an administrator
2. Go to Site Administration > Plugins > Web Services > Manage tokens
3. Create a new token with the necessary permissions to manage courses
4. Copy the generated token and add it to your `.env` file

## Security

- Never share your `.env` file or Moodle API token
- Ensure the MCP server only has access to the courses it needs to manage
- Use a token with the minimum necessary permissions
